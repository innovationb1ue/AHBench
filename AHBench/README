# Environment Prepare

* Only support Linux
* JDK installed, version must be above 1.8
* Python installed, version must be 2.4/2.5/2.6/2.7

# Configuration

## HBase Connection Configuration

Set hbase connection in "conf/hbase-site.xml"

## Environment Configuration

Configure "conf/ahbench-env.properties" file with:
* JAVA_HOME     : JDK installed path
* HBASE_VERSION : HBase cluster version, 1 or 2
* COMPRESSION   : Compression algorithm for testing table, default is SNAPPY.
                  ZSTD is available when testing AliHBaseUE

## Benchmark settings Configuration

Configure "conf/ahbench-settings.properties" file with:
* COMPRESSION   : Compression algorithm for testing table, default is SNAPPY.
                  ZSTD is available when testing AliHBaseUE
* ENCODING      : Encoding algorithm for testing table, default is DIFF. INDEX
                  is available when testing AliHBaseUE

# Run

* Execute "./fast_test" to start a quick benchmark test. This test may exam 
  the test works correctly
* Execute "./full_test" to start a full benchmark test. This test may last 
  very long
* Execute "./single_test" to start a single insert(write). 
* Execute "./batch_test" to start a batch insert(write). 

# Result 

* For fast test, check "logs/fast_throughput.csv" or "logs/fast_spike_latency.csv"
* For full test, check "logs/full_throughput.csv" or "logs/full_spike_latency.csv"
